## Academic Projects

**1. Custom Selectable Text Widget for Controlled Text Selection in Mobile device (Jan 2021 – Apr 2021)** <br/>
**Project description:** In this course project, I focused on text selection and layout, where I developed a customized text selection widget that will offer additional functionality in addition to what generally comes with the default text selection widget in most mobile apps. My developed widget will give users more control over text selection and layout than the default one. The solution is initially designed for Text selection and layout on mobile devices.<br/>
**Programming platform:** Android, Dart (Flutter).

**2. COVID-19 Disease Tracking (Mar 2020 – Jun 2020)**<br/>
**Project description:** In this project, As a member of the development team, I developed an MVP mobile application for disease tracking during COVID-19 for both Android and iPhone. We explored the possibility to use technology to contain highly infectious diseases through GPS data sharing. And our results show that people are, very often, willing to share their GPS data in an effort to contain highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19, as long as their privacy is protected. Our conclusion indicates the great potential to use novel approaches to tackle highly infectious diseases such as COVID-19.<br/>

**3. Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) Classification from real-life clinical data (Jan 2020 – May 2020)**<br/>
**Project description:** This is an individual project under the [Visual and Automated Disease Analytics (VADA)](https://vada.cs.umanitoba.ca/) program which is a graduate-level seminar course. This program is a joint initiative between the University of Manitoba and the University of Victoria. As a part of this program, I completed a data science project which includes: I) Data Management Plan, Data dictionary, and Data Quality Report of CKD data set (II)Analysis which includes Cluster analysis, Regression, Classification and Dimension reduction, and (III) Visualization of useful insights using Tableau.<br/>
**Programming platform and Tools:** R, Python, and Tableau.

**4. In-situation 3D Data visualization and Interaction using a smart wearable ring (Jan 2020 – Mar 2020)**<br/>
**Project description:** Wearable technologies, such as watches, rings, and head-worn displays (HWDs) are becoming commonplace nowadays. In this project, we tried to develop a prototype where we are interested to interact and answer some complex queries from a 3D visualization using a smart wearable ring. The main objective was to design some complex and accurate interactions which include analyzing a data set after visualization, perform different actions like selecting, finding patterns, answering some important questions, revealing better insight from a 3D visualization.<br/>
**Programming platform and Tools:** C#, Unity.
